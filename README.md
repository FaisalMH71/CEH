How to pass Ec-council Certified Ethical Hacker - CEHv11 exam by Faisal Mohammed- 2023


Are you preparing for your CEH exam in the coming months or weeks?, you are in the right place because I will provide you with all the resources that you need upon my expierence to absouloutly smash that CEH exam, I scored 124/125 in the CEHv11 exam by following this approach, first of all you have actually two approaches to get this certificate:

1-The first approach is the actual slow learning road and this is best suited for people that have time to prepare and actually have interest in the materials, and CEH content are no doubt enjoyable.

2-The second approach is for people who are in rush and just wanting to get the certificate, alright I understand your motives to get this certificate since it's appealing to the HR people, and you too will be provided with a strategy to smash this certificate with couple of weeks or less!.

#The first approach roadmap:
1-Scimming the actual CEH book for reference only (if you have it),  don't even try to go through the whole book to study for the exam! you don't have to go trhough all that shit, following the Pareto rule 20/80, let's say you should only study that 20% that matters in the book.

-Tip: use CherryTree to take notes, it's convinent and has a good tree structure.

2-Study the "CEH Certified Ethical Hacker All-in-One Exam Guide" by Matthew Walker since it's the best source out there for this specific certificate, and it has a great practicing questions, you better study it if you have time.

3-Have a term or a word that you're not familiar with?, a weired interente protocol?, learn about it on Youtube!, Here are some of my favorite channels that I actually used for my preparation to the exam:

1-NetworkChuck -> one of the most famous hacking Youtube channels.
2-PowerCert Animated Videos -> great and to the point content, specifically for network protocols and network specific subjects.


3-Practicing exam quesitions is necessary here to guarantee passing the exam, or what they call "exam dumps", the websites and sources of the exam dumps varies, the one that I used called examtopics, it was the best resource at the time in my opinion, why? well first of all this is the one that I used, second of all it comes with a discussion section to see other people discuss about whetehr the answer is true or not if there's any type of mistakes in the answers!.


4-Alternate between studying the materials and studyign dumps, focus on the things that came in dumps.


BOOM after following that protocol or approach, you can now go to the exam with confidence that you'll get that badass CEH exam crushed, good luck!

#The second approach roadmap:
Easy!, just go through the "dumps" and study them, you better remember them well, and most of the time you will see alot of the questions comes in the actual exam, as a matter of fact some people just study the dumps couple of hours before the actual exam, and they enter the exam and attack it with no problems!, BUT IT'S RISKY OF COURSE.
